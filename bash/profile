# Bash will first read .bash_profile for setting environment alias and this directs it to this file.
# to understand why read about .bashrc and .bash_profile files ->
#    http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile
# Basically it if for making sure that the same environments are set if you ever switch terminal from
# say bash -> zshell or something else, who always reads the .profile first. If you switch to another
# terminal make sure to add a script to the .___profile file that reads the this file first.
#
# Example for .bash_profile:
#
# if [ -r ~/.profile ]; then . ~/.profile; fi
# case "$-" in *i*) if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi;; esac
